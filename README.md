dozenal-droid
=============

A set of Android apps using the dozenal system; clock, calendar, calculator, measurement converter (English, SI, TGM).

Please note that this software is *beta*; the code is
probably quite ugly (I'm not very familiar with Java), and
not everything will work perfectly.  However, the author has
found that, for his purposes, things do work pretty darn
well.  I've been using these programs for several months and
haven't had any real problems with them.
