.SH NAME
dozstring \- conversion of string-embedded decimals to dozenals
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dozstring [-nxep] 
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B dozstring
Inhales a string (which is considered any series of bytes
from start until EOF, including tabs and newlines) from
standard input, devours any decimal numbers it finds, and
emits the same string with the same length with the decimal
numbers converted to dozenal (base twelve), truncated or
padded as necessary.

This ensures that all strings will be printed the same
length as they came in.  Originally, this was devised to
convert index lines in the mutt mail client to be printed in
dozenal; preserving length was very important for this use
case.

Take note that this method will not do what you want in
certain cases.  For example, some "numbers" are really
labels, such as highway numbers; this program will convert
them all despite this fact.  Only use this program on
strings that you're sure only contain numbers that you
actually want converted.

If you really want to use this program on a string with
numbers that you don't want converted, you'll need to modify
your string.  Numbers that should *not* be converted should
be suffixed with a star ('*').  dozstring will
.I not
remove this star character, unless it is asked to remove it
with the '-s' option.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP -x
Indicates the character the user would like to use for digit
ten.  Defaults to 'X'.  Multicharacter string arguments will
be silently truncated.
.IP -e
Indicates the character the user would like to use for digit
eleven.  Defaults to 'E'.  Multicharacter string arguments
will be silently truncated.
.IP -p
Indicates the character the user would like to use to pad
numbers if necessary; e.g., if the decimal number is "11",
indicates the character to put to the left of "E" in the
converted result.  Defaults to '0'; so decimal "11" converts
to "0E".  Multicharacter string arguments will be silently
truncated.
.IP -n
Add a newline to the output.  Note that if standard input
ends in a newline, standard output will end with one
already.  However, if there is no newline in the standard
input, this option will add one to the output, as the last
byte.
.IP -s
Remove the star character from unconverted numbers.
dozstring allows users to suffix numbers which should
.I not
be converted into dozenal (e.g., highway numbers, badge
numbers, and the like) with '*'.  There can be no spaces
between the number and the '*'.  Normally, the star is left
in the output to retain the same width of the text.  If this
option is specified, however, dozstring will remove the
star.  This means that the output text will not be the same
width as the input; however, it also means that text can be
converted en masse without the risk of converting what
shouldn't be, and without having extraneous characters in
the output.
.IP -c
Convert the string which is given as an argument here,
rather than taking the string from standard input.  This is
length-limited; the length is probably plenty long enough,
but if you give dozstring too long a string, it will
obediently complain and die.  If you really must do the
string all at once, try giving it to dozstring on standard
input, which is 
.I not
length-limited.  E.g.:  "echo $string | dozstring".
.SH ERROR CODES
.IP 1
Indicates that an option was given which dozstring doesn't
recognize.
.IP 2
Indicates that dozstring was given an explicit string to
convert with the "-c" option, but that this string was too
long.  If the string is instead given as standard input,
dozstring can handle it.
.SH BUGS
None known at this time.
