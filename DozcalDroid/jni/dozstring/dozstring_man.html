dozstring - conversion of string-embedded decimals to dozenals 
<h2><a name='sect1' href='#toc1'>Synopsis</a></h2>
<b>dozstring
[-nxep] </b> 
<h2><a name='sect2' href='#toc2'>Description</a></h2>
<b>dozstring</b> Inhales a string (which is considered any
series of bytes from start until EOF, including tabs and newlines) from
standard input, devours any decimal numbers it finds, and emits the same
string with the same length with the decimal numbers converted to dozenal
(base twelve), truncated or padded as necessary. 
<p> This ensures that all
strings will be printed the same length as they came in.  Originally, this
was devised to convert index lines in the mutt mail client to be printed
in dozenal; preserving length was very important for this use case. 
<p> Take
note that this method will not do what you want in certain cases.  For example,
some "numbers" are really labels, such as highway numbers; this program
will convert them all despite this fact.  Only use this program on strings
that you&rsquo;re sure only contain numbers that you actually want converted. 
<p>
If you really want to use this program on a string with numbers that you
don&rsquo;t want converted, you&rsquo;ll need to modify your string.  Numbers that should
*not* be converted should be suffixed with a star (&rsquo;*&rsquo;).  dozstring will <i>not</i>
remove this star character, unless it is asked to remove it with the &rsquo;-s&rsquo;
option. 
<h2><a name='sect3' href='#toc3'>Options</a></h2>

<dl>

<dt>-x</dt>
<dd>Indicates the character the user would like to use for digit
ten.  Defaults to &rsquo;X&rsquo;.  Multicharacter string arguments will be silently truncated.
</dd>

<dt>-e</dt>
<dd>Indicates the character the user would like to use for digit eleven.  Defaults
to &rsquo;E&rsquo;.  Multicharacter string arguments will be silently truncated. </dd>

<dt>-p</dt>
<dd>Indicates
the character the user would like to use to pad numbers if necessary; e.g.,
if the decimal number is "11", indicates the character to put to the left
of "E" in the converted result.  Defaults to &rsquo;0&rsquo;; so decimal "11" converts
to "0E".  Multicharacter string arguments will be silently truncated. </dd>

<dt>-n</dt>
<dd>Add
a newline to the output.  Note that if standard input ends in a newline,
standard output will end with one already.  However, if there is no newline
in the standard input, this option will add one to the output, as the last
byte. </dd>

<dt>-s</dt>
<dd>Remove the star character from unconverted numbers. dozstring allows
users to suffix numbers which should <i>not</i> be converted into dozenal (e.g.,
highway numbers, badge numbers, and the like) with &rsquo;*&rsquo;.  There can be no spaces
between the number and the &rsquo;*&rsquo;.  Normally, the star is left in the output
to retain the same width of the text.  If this option is specified, however,
dozstring will remove the star.  This means that the output text will not
be the same width as the input; however, it also means that text can be
converted en masse without the risk of converting what shouldn&rsquo;t be, and
without having extraneous characters in the output. </dd>

<dt>-c</dt>
<dd>Convert the string
which is given as an argument here, rather than taking the string from
standard input.  This is length-limited; the length is probably plenty long
enough, but if you give dozstring too long a string, it will obediently
complain and die.  If you really must do the string all at once, try giving
it to dozstring on standard input, which is  <i>not</i> length-limited.  E.g.:  "echo
$string | dozstring". </dd>
</dl>

<h2><a name='sect4' href='#toc4'>Error Codes</a></h2>

<dl>

<dt>1</dt>
<dd>Indicates that an option was given which
dozstring doesn&rsquo;t recognize. </dd>

<dt>2</dt>
<dd>Indicates that dozstring was given an explicit
string to convert with the "-c" option, but that this string was too long.
 If the string is instead given as standard input, dozstring can handle
it. </dd>
</dl>
