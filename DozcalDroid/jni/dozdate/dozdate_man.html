<h2><a name='sect4' href='#toc4'>Format</a></h2>
<b>FORMAT
</b> controls the output; that is, inputting these sequences (probably should
enclose them in double quotes, just to be sure) will produce the resulting
figures. <b>Percent format sequences </b> (beginning with a "%" and followed by
a letter) produce normal date and time numbers;  <b>at-sign format sequences</b>
(beginning with an "@" and followed by a letter) produce TGM-specific date
and time numbers.  All numbers produced by dozdate are dozenal, and all
numbers fed to it are assumed to be dozenal. 
<p> Interpreted sequences are:

<dl>

<dt>@c </dt>
<dd>Produces a reasonably complete depiction of the date
and time; that is, weekday day month year time.  E.g., "Thu 18 Oct 11E7 0E;3300".
</dd>

<dt>@C </dt>
<dd>Produces the first two digits of the dozenal year without the last two;
in other words, the zentury.  So, e.g., for this year (11E7/2011), it produces
"11".  Similar to %c, except for the dozenal year. </dd>

<dt>@y </dt>
<dd>Produces the last two
digits of the dozenal year without the first two; so, for this year (11E7/2011),
it produces "E7". </dd>

<dt>@t </dt>
<dd>Produces the number of Tims since the last hour (0000-10000).
 (Range is normally only through EEEE, but the extra is to allow for occasional
leap seconds.) </dd>

<dt>@m </dt>
<dd>Number of quaduaTims, to two places; essentially @t truncated

</dl>

<h2><a name='sect7' href='#toc7'>Format
Specifiers</a></h2>
Any of the "@" format specifiers may be further specified in
terms of padding.  After the "%" or "@" but before the letter comes the
optional field width; e.g., "@5H" will give the hour, in dozenal, in a field
five characters wide, three zeroes and the hour.  Prior to the field width
can come an optional character which will be used for padding instead of
zeroes.  E.g., "@5^H" will pad the field with "^" rather than zeroes. <p>
Note that
this differs from GNU date, which uses "^" and "#" to specify change of
case; dozdate instead interprets these as padding characters. <p>
By default,
dozdate pads with zeroes, but any non-letter and non-number character can
be used.  In GNU date, an underscore ("_") pads with blanks, but dozdate
doesn&rsquo;t do this in case the user actually wants to pad with underscores;
instead, an open square bracket ("[") pads with blanks.  It seemed very
unlikely that anyone would want to pad fields with this character. <p>
Any number,
no matter how absurd, can be used as a padding figure.  (Not quite true;
it has to fit within a C "int" variable.)  These numbers are dozenal, of
course. <p>
The "@" format sequences are extremely flexible with their padding
in this way; the "%" format sequences instead work precisely as they do
in GNU date.  The only options are "-" (to suppress padding); "_" (to pad
with blanks); "0" (to pad with zeroes); "^" (to use uppercase if possible);
and "#" (to use the opposite case if possible).  This is for compatibility
purposes; I&rsquo;d like dozdate to be as near a drop-in replacement for GNU date
as possible.  But that&rsquo;s no reason to handicap the dozdate extensions. <p>
Examples:
<blockquote>"@5y" --- "000E7" </blockquote>
<blockquote>"@[5y" --- "   E7" </blockquote>
<blockquote>"@#5y" --- "###E7" </blockquote>
And so forth. 
<p> 
<h2><a name='sect8' href='#toc8'>Date Strings</a></h2>
dozdate
will accept some fairly flexible strings as dates to be formatted (fed
to it by the -d option or as lines in a file).  Still, it&rsquo;s not a natural
language interpreter, and it does only understand a limited number of formats.
<p>
RELATIVE DATES <p>
Relatives dates specify the dates relative to the current
one.  Currently, dozdate only accepts relative dates based on the weekday.
 It accepts three such types of dates in any of four formats: 
<p> <blockquote><i>last</i>  WEEKDAY
(e.g., "last Friday") </blockquote>
<blockquote>WEEKDAY (e.g., "Friday") </blockquote>
<blockquote><i>this</i>  WEEKDAY (e.g., "this Friday")
</blockquote>
<blockquote><i>next</i>  WEEKDAY (e.g., "next Friday") </blockquote>

<p> Using the keyword "this" plus the weekday
is equivalent to using the weekday by itself.  The keyword "last" yields
the given weekday immediately prior to the current date; "this" or no keyword
yields the weekday immediately after the current date; "next" yields the
weekday immediately after the current date  <i>plus seven,</i> accordingly to
colloquial usage.  Note that this differs from the behavior of GNU date,
which considers "this" and "next" synonymous. 
<p> Weekdays can be entered in
their full form, or in an abbreviated form; any abbreviation that includes
the first three letters of the weekday name will be understood.  (That is,
"Thursday" "Thursda", "Thursd", "Thurs", "Thur", and "Thu" are all synonymous.)
 They do, however, need to begin with a capital letter and be followed
by lowercase letters. 
<p> <p>
ABSOLUTE DATES <p>
dozdate will also accept a variety
of formats for absolute dates, more or less as those accepted by GNU date.
 However, unlike GNU date, dozdate insists that years be given in four
digits, and it also accepts dozenal numbers rather than decimal ones, for
obvious reasons. <p>
Any of the following formats for inputting dates will be
accepted and correctly understood by dozdate: <p>
<blockquote>11X8-2-25 </blockquote>
<blockquote>25 February 11X8
</blockquote>
<blockquote>25February11X8 </blockquote>
<blockquote>25 Feb 11X8 </blockquote>
<blockquote>25Feb11X8 </blockquote>
<blockquote>February 25, 11X8 </blockquote>
<blockquote>Feb 25, 11X8 </blockquote>
<blockquote>2/25/11X8
</blockquote>
<p>
Leading zeroes in these numbers are ignored; indeed, leading  <i>anything</i>
in these numbers are ignored.  If you input "225 Feb 11X8", dozdate will
simply devour what it can and ignore the rest, assuming that you meant
"25 Feb 11X8."  Note that this behavior can be unpredictable; if you use
the common American "slash format," "2/225/11X8", dozdate parses the numbers
from the other direction, so you&rsquo;ll get 22 Feb 11X8 instead.  Due to this
unpredictability, it&rsquo;s not really safe to rely on this behavior except for
leading zeroes up to the normal number of digits (e.g., "02/02/11X8"). <p>
Months
may be abbreviated as desired, provided that the abbreviations contain
at least the first three letters of the month.  This allows dozdate to accept
non-standard abbreviations like "Sept" for "September".  They do, however,
need to begin with a capital letter and be followed by lowercase letters.
<p>
Incomplete dates can be accepted, as well.  If the year is omitted, dozdate
will assume the current year.  If the date is omitted but the month is given,
dozdate will assume the first day of the month.  If the month and date is
omitted but the year is given, dozdate will assume the first day of January.
<p>
This reasonably graceful system breaks down on the characteristically American
"slash format."  E.g., entering "2/11X8" will cause dozdate to interpret the
"11" as the date, and it will emit "11 Feb 11X8", probably not what was
intended.  This is because the American style of date formatting really
doesn&rsquo;t make sense; it&rsquo;s neither little-endian nor big-endian, going neither
from smallest unit to largest nor vice-versa.  However, the other numeric
formats do the right thing here; "11X8-2" will correctly be interpreted
as "1 Feb 11X8". <p>
If you ask dozdate for a particular date, but give it the
wrong weekday, dozdate will silently correct this and output the correct
weekday. <p>
TIMES <p>
dozdate understands times in either our accustomed mongrel
decimal/dozenal/sexagesimal system (that is, hours, minutes, and seconds)
or in the coherent and rationally dozenal TGM format (hours and Tims). <p>
TGM
times are formatted as HH;TTTT.  There are, of course, 10000 Tims in an
hour, so this format makes sense.  dozdate also understands a "short time,"
similar to our common practice of reading the time in hours and minutes
while omitting seconds, involving only the first two digits of the number
of Tims:  HH;TT.  A semicolon must be used, or dozdate will think the user
intends sexagesimal time and interpret it accordingly.  Giving a number
of Tims greater than EEEE will cause dozdate to simply truncate the trailing
digits and use the result figure. <p>
Omitting the number of Tims (e.g., "2;")
will cause dozdate to assume a number of Tims the first digit of which
is idential to the hour.  So the above example will yield "2;1EEE" (or "2;2000",
depending on how your machine rounds it). <p>
Sexagesimal times are formatted
as usual:  HH:MM:SS. Seconds can be omitted without consequence; dozdate
will simply assume "00".  Minutes can be omitted, but dozdate will assume
the current number of minutes.  If minutes are going to be omitted, one
must still use the colon; e.g., "3:".  Otherwise, dozdate won&rsquo;t know what the
number is doing and will simply ignore it. <p>
If the time is omitted entirely,
dozdate will assume midnight ("00;0000", or "00:00:00").

<dl>

<dt>0</dt>
<dd>Successful return, no errors detected. </dd>

<dt>1</dt>
<dd>The date string requires there
to be more dates in the month than there really are.  E.g., it requires there

<dt>2</dt>
<dd>Requested 29 February, or a date in Irvember if using
the Symm676 calendar, but this isn&rsquo;t a leap year. </dd>

<dt>3</dt>
<dd>Bad month; the month you&rsquo;ve
requested doesn&rsquo;t exist.  E.g., "15". </dd>

<dt>4</dt>
<dd>Bad conversion code, either "%" or "@";
dozdate doesn&rsquo;t recognize what you&rsquo;re asking it to do. </dd>

<dt>5</dt>
<dd>Insufficient memory
to process the format string you&rsquo;ve requested.  It&rsquo;s exceedingly unlikely
that you&rsquo;ll ever run into this. </dd>

<dt>6</dt>
<dd>Bad file; dozdate can&rsquo;t open the file that
you&rsquo;ve asked it to process. </dd>

<dt>7</dt>
<dd>Bad hour; the hour you&rsquo;ve asked for isn&rsquo;t a sensible
value. E.g., it&rsquo;s not 00-1E (in decimal, 00-23). </dd>

<dt>8</dt>
<dd>Bad minute; the minute you&rsquo;ve
asked for isn&rsquo;t a sensible value.  E.g., it&rsquo;s not 00-4E (in decimal, 00-59). </dd>

<dt>9</dt>
<dd>Bad
second; the second you&rsquo;ve asked for isn&rsquo;t a sensible value.  E.g., it&rsquo;s not 00-50
(in decimal, 00-60).  Note that this allows for an extra second to permit
leap seconds to be handled properly, but it does not checking as to whether
a leap second actually fell during that hour. </dd>

<dt>10</dt>
<dd>Bad year; the year you&rsquo;ve
requested is either too large or too small.  Note the dozdate works with
the Gregorian calendar, and its tables only go back to 0E98 (decimal 1700)
and forward to 168E (decimal 2699).  So anything outside of that range will
error because dozdate can&rsquo;t figure out the day of the week with its current
tables. </dd>
