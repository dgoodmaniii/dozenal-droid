<h2><a name='sect0' href='#toc0'>Name</a></h2>
tgmconv - converter for measurements in the TGM, metric, imperial,
and customary systems.  Inputs and outputs only in dozenal. 
<h2><a name='sect1' href='#toc1'>Synopsis</a></h2>
<b>tgmconv
[-k</b> <i>precision</i> <b>] [-i </b> <i>input</i> unit <b>] [-o</b> <i>output</i> unit <b>]</b> <b>quantity</b> 
<h2><a name='sect2' href='#toc2'>Description</a></h2>
<b>tgmconv</b>
Converts the given quantity from the input unit to the output unit.  At
present, both input and output units must be given manually at the command
line.  Works with simple units (like "Grafut" and "second") and compound
units of arbitrary complexity (like "S*m/m2"). 
<h2><a name='sect3' href='#toc3'>Options</a></h2>

<dl>

<dt>-k precision</dt>
<dd>Print the
resulting output with  <i>precision</i> digits of precision.  By default, the output
is printed with four digits after the zenimal point.  If there is no fractional
part, no zenimal point or fractional digits will be printed, even if this
option is specified.  If the precision is too high, a message will be printed
noting this, and the precision will be reduced to the system&rsquo;s maximum. 
If you give it a negative number, you will confuse it mightily, and it
will resolve the confusion by dropping into standard input and waiting
for you to give it something sensible. </dd>

<dt>-i input unit</dt>
<dd>Specifies what unit tgmconv
will be receiving the quantity in.  This argument is optional  <i>if</i> you provide
the input unit with the quantity itself, for which see the section on the
quantity argument below. </dd>

<dt>-o output unit</dt>
<dd>Specifies the unit that tgmconv should
convert the entered quantity of the input unit into.  Strictly necessary
if the output unit is not TGM; not strictly necessary if it is TGM, unless
you want the unit multiplied or divided by an exponent. </dd>

<dt>quantity</dt>
<dd>Must be
the final argument on the command line.  This is the number of input units
that will be converted to output units.  Must be a dozenal number; tgmconv
will interpret it as such regardless of the user&rsquo;s actual intent. 
<p> Optionally,
the input unit may be specified with the input quantity, if the  <i>-i</i> option
is not being used.  (If the  <i>-i</i> option  <i>is</i> used, then tgmconv will assume
that your unit is supposed to be part of your number, and most probably
throw an error unless your unit and separator consist entirely of dozenal
characters.)  To do this, simply enter the quantity as normal (a valid dozenal
number); follow it with some character which is  <i>not</i> a dozenal number character
(the author has taken to  using &rsquo;:&rsquo;, but any character not a dozenal number
character  will do fine); and then enter the unit one wishes to convert.

<p> For example, entering  <i>3:km/hr</i> will cause tgmconv to convert 3 kilometers
per hour into the appropriate unit, either TGM&rsquo;s Vlos (by default) or whatever
unit is specified by the <i>-o</i> option. 
<p> It&rsquo;s important to be cautious here, and
make sure that the input  <i>unit</i> is separated by a non-dozenal character from
the input  <i>quantity</i> that is entered.  For example, if one enters <i>3km/hr</i>
, one has entered perfectly valid input, and tgmconv will obediently convert
it.  However, it will convert 3  <i>meters</i> per hour, not kilometers.  When it
encounters the  <i>k</i> , tgmconv will quite reasonably assume that this ends
the quantity portion of the argument, and will begin the unit portion on
the  <i>m</i> which is finds next.  It is unlikely that this result is what the
user desires.  However, there&rsquo;s little to be done for it.  Otherwise, there
would be no way to tell if, for example, an &rsquo;A&rsquo; in the input was the start
of a unit (for example, the Ag) or simply the number ten.  Some separating
unit is necessary; the best tgmconv can do is allow the user to employ
whatever separator he wants, provided it can&rsquo;t be confused for a dozenal
character. </dd>
</dl>

<h2><a name='sect4' href='#toc4'>Unit Syntax</a></h2>
TGM units have a simple syntax.  They are entered simply
as is.  To multiply by an exponent, begin it with the desired exponent and
a &rsquo;^&rsquo;:  3^Gf for trinaGrafuts.  To divide it, use a &rsquo;_&rsquo; instead:  3_Gf for triniGrafuts.

<p> Building metric units can be done in the usual way by combining the canonical
metric unit abbreviations (e.g., "m" for "meter", "g" for "gram") with the
prefixes as normal. However, some of the higher prefixes won&rsquo;t work as written
because they conflict with TGM units when combined with certain metric
units (for example, "megagram," canonically "Mg," conflicts with the Mag,
and "terameter," canonically "Tm", conflicts with the Tim).  Consequently,
some need to written out differently. 
<p> "Exa" must be written out "Ex" (example:
 "Exm" for "exameter"); "peta" must be written out "Pe" (example: "PeV"
for "petavolt"); "tera" must be written out "Te" (example:  "TeV" for "teravolt");
and "mega" must be written out "Me" (example:  "Meg" for "megagram").  All
the other prefixes can be affixed as normal. 
<p> For metric and imperial units,
compound units have a fairly tight but intuitive syntax.  There is no need
to specify exponents; any digit that&rsquo;s encountered will be treated as a
positive exponent.  When units are being multiplied, a specific mention
of this is necessary; a "*" character is probably easiest, though as a
practical matter any character other than a dozenal character (0-9, A, B,
T, X, E) or a &rsquo;-&rsquo; would work. 
<p> As an example, the TGM unit of conductivity
is the Eldu. The metric unit of conductivity is the Siemen-meter per square
meter.  To enter the metric unit, use the appropriate abbreviations connected
with &rsquo;*&rsquo; and &rsquo;/&rsquo;: 
<p> <i>S*m/m2</i> 
<p> (Incidentally, "mho", the old term for the Siemen,
will also work here.)  Many metric units are compound where TGM provides
a single unit, so learning this idiom is essential if tgmconv is to be
used at all heavily.  Fortunately, it&rsquo;s not a complicated matter. 
<p> Another
down side is that tgmconv is too stupid (or, really, too smart) to understand
non-standard abbreviations.  A common abbreviation in America for "miles
per hour" is "mph", for example; tgmconv would have no idea what "mph"
was supposed to mean.  To get "miles per hour", one must enter "mi/hr",
which tgmconv will understand exactly. Similarly, "psi", as the common abbreviation
for "pounds per square inch", would be incomprehensible for tgmconv; but
entering "lbf/in2" will yield the correct answer. 
<h2><a name='sect5' href='#toc5'>Permissible Units</a></h2>
Unfortunately,
at this point tgmconv&rsquo;s syntax is relatively fascistic; it insists on receiving
its units in a canonical abbreviated format, in addition to the syntax
for composite units explained above.  Below is a list of the acceptable
units and their abbreviations for TGM, metric, and customary/imperial,
plus a brief statement of each unit&rsquo;s purpose.

</dl>

<h2><a name='sect7' href='#toc7'>Metric Units</a></h2>

<dl>

<dt>second --- s</dt>
<dd>The metric unit of time. </dd>

<dt>meter --- m</dt>
<dd>The metric
unit of length. </dd>

<dt>angstrom --- ang</dt>
<dd>The normal abbreviation for this is a Scandinavian
letter &rsquo;A&rsquo; with a circle over it; for obvious reasons, tgmconv expects it
abbreviated with "ang".  Equal to X^-X. </dd>

<dt>fermi --- fm</dt>
<dd>This is equal to the femtometer,
an unimaginably tiny length.  Actually, tgmconv knows of no such unit; but
since the abbreviation for "femtometer" and "fermi" are both "fm", you
can think of this as a fermi if you wish, and tgmconv will still give you
the correct answer. </dd>

<dt>hectare --- ha</dt>
<dd>The metric unit of area, comparable to hectares.
 (The "official" unit of area is generally considered the square meter,
comparable to the square yard or square foot.) </dd>

<dt>gram --- g</dt>
<dd>The metric unit of
mass.  This was a bit of a tough decision.  The SI standard specifies the
 <i>kilogram</i> as the basic unit of mass; however, it comes ready-made with a
prefix meaning "ten to the third", and a gram is one thousandth of a kilgram.
 So tgmconv assumes that the gram is the basic unit, rather than the kilogram,
so that the algorithms won&rsquo;t get messed up.  The abbreviation "kg" still
works fine, anyway. </dd>

<dt>metric ton --- t</dt>
<dd>Spelled "tonne" by non-American English
speakers, this is equal to one thousand kilograms.  In other words, it&rsquo;s
really a megagram (Meg), and entering either "t" or "Meg" will yield the
same result. </dd>

<dt>atomic mass unit --- u</dt>
<dd></dd>

<dt>Dalton --- Da</dt>
<dd>These are equivalent; they both
equal the approximate mass of a proton (or a neutron).  In grams, about
1.660538782e-24.  (Yes, protons and neutrons are crazy small.) </dd>

<dt>liter --- L</dt>
<dd>The
metric unit of volume.  Sort of.  This used to be the metric unit of volume,
but SI makes the cubic meter that unit, which is something substantially
larger.  The liter is, at least conceptually, the volume of one square 
<i>decimeter</i> ; technically, it was defined as the volume of one kilogram of
pure water at four degrees celsius and 760 mm of mercury pressure.  However,
that definition yielded a liter equal to about 1.000028 dm3.  Because for
quite a long time that was what a liter was, tgmconv converts liters according
to this old definition.  If you want cubic decimeters, ask for them: dm3.
</dd>

<dt>Newton --- N</dt>
<dd>The metric unit of force.  The force required to accelerate one
kg at a rate of one m/s2. </dd>

<dt>Dyne --- dyn</dt>
<dd>An old unit of force, the centimeter-gram-second;
equal to one ten-thousandth of a Newton. </dd>

<dt>gram-force --- gf</dt>
<dd>Another metric unit
of force; the force exerted on one gram by an acceleration of one metric
standard gravity (about 9.806 m/s2).  Usually expressed in kgf.  The kgf,
then, is equal to 9.806 N. </dd>

<dt>Pascal --- Pa</dt>
<dd>The metric unit of pressure and stress.
</dd>

<dt>Metric Standard Atmosphere --- atm</dt>
<dd>The metric standard atmosphere. </dd>

<dt>bar --- bar</dt>
<dd>A
metric unit of pressure; typically cited in millibars (mbar). </dd>

<dt>mHg --- meters
of mercury</dt>
<dd>A metric unit of pressure; similar to inches of mercury. Usually
cited in millimeters of mercury (mmHg), which is not  quite equal to the
Torr, but pretty close. </dd>

<dt>Torr --- Torr</dt>
<dd>Another metric unit of pressure, equal
to 1/760 of a standard atmosphere.  Named for Evangelista Torricelli, who
discovered the principle of the barometer. </dd>

<dt>Ampere-turn --- At</dt>
<dd>The metric unit
of magnetomotive force. </dd>

<dt>Joule --- J</dt>
<dd>The metric unit of energy or work. </dd>

<dt>Calorie
--- cal</dt>
<dd>Another unit of energy or work.  There were many types of calorie; tgmconv
only knows one, the 15 degree calorie. </dd>

<dt>erg --- erg</dt>
<dd>An older metric unit of energy
or work; it&rsquo;s equal to 10.0e-7 Joules. </dd>

<dt>electron volt --- eV</dt>
<dd>Another unit of energy
or work, quite common in physics. It&rsquo;s got a complex technical definition;
the bottom line is that it&rsquo;s very tiny, equal to 1.60217653e-19 Joules. </dd>

<dt>Watt
--- W</dt>
<dd>The metric unit of power. </dd>

<dt>Watt-hour --- Wh</dt>
<dd>Another metric unit of energy or
work.  Equals 3.6 megajoules.  Usually listed in kilowatt-hours, kWh. </dd>

<dt>Hertz
--- Hz</dt>
<dd>The metric unit of frequency. </dd>

<dt>Ampere --- A</dt>
<dd>The metric unit of electrical
current. </dd>

<dt>Volt --- V</dt>
<dd>The metric unit of electromotive force, or "voltage". </dd>

<dt>Ohm
--- ohm</dt>
<dd>The metric unit of resistance. </dd>

<dt>Mho --- mho</dt>
<dd></dd>

<dt>Siemens --- S</dt>
<dd>The metric units of
conductance, the reciprocal of resistance in ohms.  "Mho" is the old term,
"Siemens" is the new term; tgmconv accepts both. </dd>

<dt>Coulomb --- C</dt>
<dd>The metric unit
of electric charge. </dd>

<dt>Faraday --- faraday</dt>
<dd>"Faraday&rsquo;s constant," the amount of electrical
charge in one mole of electrons.  It&rsquo;s equal to about 96485.339924 C. </dd>

<dt>Farad
--- F</dt>
<dd>The metric unit of capacitance. </dd>

<dt>Weber --- Wb</dt>
<dd>The metric unit of magnetic flux.
</dd>

<dt>Tesla --- T</dt>
<dd>The metric unit of magnetic flux density and magnetic induction.
</dd>

<dt>Henry --- H</dt>
<dd>The metric unit of inductance. </dd>

<dt>Becquerel --- Bq</dt>
<dd>The metric unit of radioactivity.
</dd>

<dt>Curie --- Ci</dt>
<dd>Another metric unit of radioactivity.  Equals the number of decays
per second in a gram of radium-226 (decimal), or 3.7e10 (decimal) decays
per second. </dd>

<dt>lumen --- lm</dt>
<dd>The metric unit of luminous flux. </dd>

<dt>candela --- cd</dt>
<dd>The metric
unit of luminous intensity. </dd>

<dt>Kelvin --- K</dt>
<dd>The metric unit of heat, based on absolute

<dt>Degrees Celsius --- degC</dt>
<dd>Another unit of heat; based
on the freezing point of water. Convert to decigrees. </dd>

<dt>mole --- mol</dt>
<dd>The metric
unit of amount of substance. </dd>

<dt>bel --- B</dt>
<dd>The metric unit of loudness, a subjective
measure.  Usually used in tenths, the decibel (dB).  Note that while decibels
are used in many fields, this is only the loudness decibel. </dd>

<h2><a name='sect8' href='#toc8'>Customary/Imperial
Units</a></h2>
This section includes not only customary and imperial units, but also
others that don&rsquo;t fit into either above category, like "days".  Where they
differ, the imperial versions are suffixed with an "i", the customary with
a "c".  Imperial versions are used in England and former colonies who gained
independence after the imperial reform (broadly, everyone but America);
customary versions are used in the United States. 
<dl>

<dt>foot --- ft</dt>
<dd>The customary/imperial
unit of length. </dd>

<dt>inch --- in</dt>
<dd>One zenth of a foot; a measurement of length. </dd>

<dt>mil
--- mil</dt>
<dd>A traditional tiny unit, equal to one thousandth of an inch. </dd>

<dt>yard --- yd</dt>
<dd>Another
traditional length measurement; it is equal to three feet, a bit shorter
than a meter. </dd>

<dt>fathom --- fath</dt>
<dd>A traditional length measure, generally limited
to water depths; as in, "she sank in twenty fathoms".  Equal to six feet;
not surprisingly, a half-dozen. </dd>

<dt>rod --- rod</dt>
<dd>A traditional unit of measure, rarely
used these days, equal to five and a half yards. </dd>

<dt>furlong --- furl</dt>
<dd>A traditional
unit of land measure; equal to six hundred and sixty feet.  Originally,
acres were one furlong long and one chain wide; nowadays, they can be any
shape. </dd>

<dt>mile --- mi</dt>
<dd>A traditional unit of length, used in mostly the same circumstances
that the kilometer is used in metric.  Equal to 5,280 feet. </dd>

<dt>nautical mile
--- nmi</dt>
<dd>One minute of arc of latitude along any meridian; made equal to exactly
one thousand, eight hundred and fifty-two meters by international agreement.
</dd>

<dt>knot --- kn</dt>
<dd>A primarily maritime unit, it equals one nautical mile per hour.
 Commonly used even by metric-using seafaring countries, probably because
it has a definite relation to the meridian.  Common abbreviations are also
"kt" and "kts", but tgmconv will only accept "kn".  This is the abbreviation
specified by the International Hydrographic Organization, whichi ncludes
all major seafaring nations.  (Or so Wikipedia told me, anyway.) </dd>

<dt>astronomical
unit --- au</dt>
<dd>The approximate mean distance of the earth to the sun; really large.
</dd>

<dt>light year --- ly</dt>
<dd>The distance light travels in one year of time. </dd>

<dt>parsec --- pc</dt>
<dd>A
fancy unit having to do with parallax; enormously huge, about 3.26 light
years. </dd>

<dt>acre --- acre</dt>
<dd>A traditional unit of area measure.  Originally equal to
one furlong by one chain; now can equal 4,840.0 square yards of any shape.
</dd>

<dt>pound --- lb</dt>
<dd>The customary/imperial unit of weight and mass.  This refers to
the avoirdupois pound; troy pounds are dealt with later, and defined (internally)
in terms of avoirdupois pounds. </dd>

<dt>slug --- slug</dt>
<dd>Another customary/imperial unit
of mass.  It equals one pound-force square seconds per foot.  One could also
simply request "1:lbf*s2/ft" and get the same answer. </dd>

<dt>stone --- st</dt>
<dd>Still commonly
used in Britain, never used in America; the stone equals fourteen pounds.
 (Avoirdupois pounds, that is.) </dd>

<dt>ounce --- oz</dt>
<dd>Another unit of weight and mass;
equal to one-sixteenth of a pound.  There were several different types of
ounce, including the troy (one zenth of a troy pound), avoirdupois, and
fluid.  The fluid ounce is for volume (see below); the avoirdupois ounce
is the only weight and mass ounce that tgmconv knows.  It is typically referred
to simply as "ounce"; if one needs to distinguish, use "fluid ounce" for
the volume measure and simply "ounce" for the weight. </dd>

<dt>troy ounce --- ozt</dt>
<dd>Commonly
used only for precious metals, gems, and the like. Twelve troy ounces make
a troy pound. </dd>

<dt>troy pound --- lbt</dt>
<dd>Never used anymore; put in here because it&rsquo;s
so easy once the troy ounce has been added. </dd>

<dt>imperial ton --- toni</dt>
<dd>Another unit
of weight and mass, equal to 2,240 lbs.  An interesting number, to be sure,
because it was based on the English (or "long") hundredweight rather than
on the pound. </dd>

<dt>customary ton --- tonc</dt>
<dd>An odd name, considering that the imperial
ton is actually the customary one in this case.  The American ton is based
on the American, or "short", hundredweight, and thus equals 2,000 pounds.
</dd>

<dt>hundredweight --- cw</dt>
<dd>The English, or "long", hundredweight, equal to 112.0 pounds.
 tgmconv doesn&rsquo;t know the American or "short" hundredweight of 100.0 pounds,
because it&rsquo;s too easy to figure it out without tgmconv&rsquo;s help. </dd>

<dt>imperial gallon
--- gali</dt>
<dd>The imperial unit of volume. </dd>

<dt>imperial quart --- qti</dt>
<dd>One-fourth of an imperial
gallon; twice an imperial pint. </dd>

<dt>imperial pint --- pti</dt>
<dd>A bit too large to be
convenient for beer, the imperial pint is equal to twenty fluid ounces.
 An imperial pint of water is one pound and a quarter mass. ("A pintful
of water&rsquo;s a pound and a quarter", which apparently almost rhymes in British
English.)  It differs from the customary pint since the imperial reforms
of 1824, in which one of many different varieties of gallon was chosen
as the standard gallon.  The imperial pint is one-eighth of an imperial gallon.
 It contains twenty fluid ounces. </dd>

<dt>imperial cup --- cpi</dt>
<dd>An imperial cup. </dd>

<dt>imperial
tablespoon --- tbsi</dt>
<dd>An imperial tablespoon. </dd>

<dt>imperial teaspoon --- tspi</dt>
<dd>An imperial
teaspoon. </dd>

<dt>customary gallon --- galc</dt>
<dd>The customary unit of volume. </dd>

<dt>customary quart
--- qtc</dt>
<dd>One-fourth of a customary gallon; twice a customary pint. </dd>

<dt>customary pint
--- ptc</dt>
<dd>The perfect size for a beer (no, I&rsquo;m not biased; this is an obvious
objective fact with which no reasonable man could possibly disagree), this
is one-eighth of the customary gallon.  It masses one pound.  "A pint&rsquo;s a pound
the world around"---except, of course, that it isn&rsquo;t, at least since 1824. 
It contains sixteen fluid ounces. </dd>

<dt>customary cup --- cpc</dt>
<dd>The customary cup. </dd>

<dt>customary
tablespoon --- tbsc</dt>
<dd>The customary tablespoon. </dd>

<dt>customary teaspoon --- tspc</dt>
<dd>The customary
teaspoon. </dd>

<dt>imperial fluid ounce --- flozi</dt>
<dd>You know the drill.  One one hundred
and sixtieth of an imperial gallon. </dd>

<dt>customary fluid ounce --- flozc</dt>
<dd>One one
hundred and twenty-eighty of a customary gallon. </dd>

<dt>pounds-force --- lbf</dt>
<dd>The imperial/customary
unit of force. </dd>

<dt>inches of mercury --- inHg</dt>
<dd>The imperial/customary unit of pressure.
</dd>

<dt>British Thermal Unit --- btu</dt>
<dd>The imperial/customary unit of energy. </dd>

<dt>horsepower
--- hp</dt>
<dd>The imperial/customary unit of power. </dd>

<dt>Revolutions Per Minute --- RPM</dt>
<dd>A traditional
unit of frequency. </dd>

<dt>degrees --- deg</dt>
<dd>Degrees of angle; three hundred and sixty
of them equals a circle, or 2*pi radians. </dd>

<dt>hour --- hr</dt>
<dd>1,0000 Tims; 3,600 seconds.
</dd>

<dt>day --- day</dt>
<dd>20,0000 Tims; 86,400 seconds. </dd>

<dt>week --- wk</dt>
<dd>Seven days; a familiar unit
from around the world. </dd>

<dt>minute --- min</dt>
<dd>About 249;7249 Tims; 60.0 seconds. </dd>

<dt>year

The output unit should be deducible rationally
from the input unit.  That is, if the user is inputting Tims, it should
be clear that he wants output in seconds unless he states otherwise.  At
the present time, tgmconv can only guess the output unit if the output
unit is in TGM; this ought to be remedied.
