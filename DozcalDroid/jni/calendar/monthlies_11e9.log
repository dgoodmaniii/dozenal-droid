I've inserted something that you may have forgotten.
(See the <inserted text> above.)
With luck, this will get me unwedged. But if you
really didn't forget anything, try typing `2' now; then

I've put in what seems to be necessary to fix
the current column of the current alignment.
Try to go on, since this might almost work.
