<h1>dozbc v1.0 Help</h1>

<p>dozbc is a simple infix dozenal (base-twelve) calculator
written in Javascript for Android.  It has the four basic
functions, square roots, exponents, parentheses for
grouping, and the two constants, &pi; and <i>e</i>.  It's
also capable of rudimentary memory functions.</p>

<p>Mostly, dozbc is pretty self-explanatory.  However, a few
of the functions deserve some comment.</p>

<ol>
<li>"&radic;" is the square-root operator; it will insert
the string "sqrt(" into your calculator field, and you will
have to input the number you want the square root of, plus
close the parentheses.  E.g., "sqrt(56)".</li>
<li>"^" is the exponentiation operator.  It's a binary
operator like addition or division, so it needs two
arguments, one before it and one behind it.  Enter them like
this:  "2^3".</li>
<li>"&plusmn;" is the negation operator.  It's important to
use this for negation (making a number negative) rather than
the subtraction sign, which won't do what you want.</li>
<li>"&larr;" will erase something; if it's a number, it'll
erase one at a time, but if it's an operator, it'll erase
the whole thing.  (E.g., it'll erase "sqrt(" all at
once.)</li>
<li>"m" adds the current input field into memory.</li>
<li>"M" takes the current memory and inserts it into the
input field.  It does <em>not</em> clear the memory, which
remains until replaced.</li>
<li>"C" clears the input field entirely.</li>
<li>The dropdown list with numbers is the precision level;
namely, the number of places after the decimal point which
dozbc will calculate.  Too many and you'll fill up your
input field, or even run it off the edge and make parts of
it invisible.  This makes sure that can't happen.  Only
values 0 through 9 are possible; the default is a reasonable
4.</li>
</ol>
